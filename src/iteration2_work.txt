Division of labor:
The task of updating the makefile was handled by Yanbang, done on his own time as the group could not come up with a good time to meet, however he made no indication that he intended to do this independently.
Isaac handled the tagging and updating of the current version of the repository, and the writing of the division of labor statement.
